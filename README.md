# espTelnetServer
Hello everyone,

i wanted to share my simple bare bone Telnet Server with you. I think its a good starting point to develop a project, especially for beginners (like me).
Took me some while to put this together so maybe you can make any use of it or get some inspiration.

I tested the code on my ESP-01 Wifi module and ESP32-Cam.

Important for the ESP-01. Use an external power source!
First i tried to use the FTL USB Programer which also provides 3.3V but it resulted in very strange behavior.
